<h1> The Importance of Free Speech </h1>
<h2>By Rafayet Hossain</h2>
<p>This site is meant to explain the various aspects of free speech among differnt countries, as not every country trasts your freedoms the same way. Free speech, and the freedom of press, is a freedom that many of us take for granted, and in some places, is a thing that not many people have. There are many reasons as to why we need to protect it, otherwise it will disspear over time, as some goverments continue to disregard these rights. </p>
