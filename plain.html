  <h2 id="a">The World Press Freedom Index</h2>
  <p> The World Press Freedom Index is a list of 180 countries ranked by the level of freedom that the country gives to journalists, based off of data from the organization Reporters Without Borders. This list is published every year since 2002. While this list ranks freedom among journalists, this can also apply to normal citizens that live in these countries. Results are determined by a questionnaire that is given to the professionals residing in the countries (if they can complete it) which contains about 87 questions and availible in 20 languages, as well as documenting every journalist abuse/violence occuring in each country and the intensity. Countries that are ranked the first on the list are among the freest countries, with freely availible information availible to the government. Countries that are ranked the lowest are among the least free countries, with abuse among journalist occuring more than usual and containing heavily censored press.
  The 5 most free countries are
  <ul>
  <li>1.Norway</li>
  <li>2.Finland</li>
  <li>3.Denmark</li>
  <li>4.Sweden</li>
  <li>5.Netherlands</li>
</ul>  
In the other hand, the 5 least free countries are 
  <ul>
  <li>180. North Korea</li>
  <li>179. Turkmenistan</li>
  <li>178. Eritrea</li>
  <li>177. China</li>
  <li>176. Dijbouti</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="b">Internet Freedom in countries</h2>
<p> Similar to the World Press Freedom Index, the organization Freedom House lists countries based on the internet freedom, or how easily citizens can freely access information on the internet. It also asseses if governments block portions of the internet, which prevent others in the country to view the content, and how your internet actions can cause legal action against you. There are also lists that sort countries based on global freedom and democracy. You can <a href="https://freedomhouse.org/countries/freedom-net/scores?sort=desc&order=Country" target="_blank">see the list </a> for yourself.   </p>
<p> The Freedom House also has a table that shows the methods of how differnt countries control and montor their internet and the citizens. These controls can be 
  <ul>
  <li>blocking social media platforms</li>
  <li>blocking content against government's views</li>
  <li>manipulating online content to push a specific idea</li>
  <li>punishments for internet actions/posting specific content</li>
  <li>increasing surveilence and decreasing internet anomymity</li>
</ul>
Countries with the most internet freedom use the least control over the citizens through internet such as Austrialia and Iceland, while countries with the least internet freedom, such as China and Cuba, use most, if not all of these controls.The table is availible <a href="https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-net/2020/key-internet-controls" target="_blank">here. </a>

<h2 id="c">Internet Usage across countries</h2>
<p> The publication Our World in Data focuses on publishing statistics and data on various topics, such as <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/internet" target="_blank">this article about internet usage on different countries.</a> This shows data about the percentage of the population that have internet access on almost every country, over the span of 1990-2017. It also shows how much the amount of internet access has increased over the years, and includes other data such as broadband access, mobile phone access, and social media access. For example, this chart at the bottom shows countries listed by the total number of internet users in that country.  </p>
